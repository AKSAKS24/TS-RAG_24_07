You are a SAP Technical Architect. 
Please find below the comprehensive outline of required sections and content for the SAP Technical Design Specification. 
Kindly ensure each point is addressed with professional depth, SAP best practices, and appropriate technical detail. 
The expectation is that this structure be expanded into a full technical specification and solution architecture for the project.

1. Document Control & Overview
Document Title/ID
System/Client
Author
Date and Version
Approvers & Sign-off
Revision history/change log
2. Purpose & Objective
Business rationale for the development or enhancement.
Value proposition and pain points addressed.
Criticality in the business context and links to strategic goals (e.g., compliance, efficiency, digitalization).
Gap analysis: Why the SAP standard is insufficient, including specific limitations/gaps.
Reference all relevant requirements/FRS/URS/change requests.
Explicit intended business outcomes and success criteria.
3. Scope
In-scope objects, processes, modules.
Out-of-scope exclusions.
SAP clients/mandants covered.
Integration points with other systems.
4. Functional Overview
Detailed business process flow.
Process triggers (manual, automated, event-based, etc.).
SAP modules and components involved.
Data journey and exception/alternative flows.
Stakeholder scenarios and referenced use cases.
List and description of all related SAP tcodes, batch jobs, and cross-functional impacts.
5. Solution Architecture & Approach
High-level architecture diagram and narrative.
Execution type(s): report, interface, enhancement, BAPI, workflow, OData, etc.
Entry and exit criteria.
Assumptions/prerequisites.
Overview of user interaction with the solution.
6. Detailed Design
6.1 Selection Screen & Input Design

Layout, fields, mandatory/optional status, dynamic logic, and data validation.
6.2 Output Design

Output media (ALV, SmartForm, Excel, PDF, etc.), layout, field definitions, export logic, and mockups.
6.3 Data Model / Database Design

Detailed table/entity list (incl. standard, custom, master, extension tables), ER diagrams, join logic, and access methods.
Field-level operations and constraints.
Buffering/caching strategies.
Maintenance and audit implications.
6.4 Technical Processing Logic (Mandatory)
Pseudo-code for core batch job:
detailed technical explanation of the requirement file in Normal English mentioning each detail for SAP developer usage.
Explanation: of the select query with where condition and joining condition aamong different tables.
Explanation: of loop and complex iteration, what is the use of it ?

- Error Handling:
   - Capture all failed records in ZSALES_ERR for reprocessing by support team.
   - Raise warning messages (Message class ZS, numbers 001â€“009).
   - For fatal failures, email responsible group using SAPConnect.

Comments:
- All data validation is done in-memory before making any BAPIs to avoid partial commits.
- Loop processing limited to 1000 records per batch (parameterized).
- Audit log entries created in ZSALES_LOG.

6.5 Code Structure & Modularity

Program name(s), includes, function groups, ABAP classes/methods, FMs/BAPIs used, events/form routines, enhancements, standard vs. custom logic, and reusable components.
6.6 Interface Design (If applicable)

Source/target systems, data mapping, file/interface specs, SAP integration technologies, error handling, sequencing, and documentation diagrams.
7. Security & Authorization
Required auth objects, sensitive data controls, role mapping, and error handling.
8. Performance & Optimization
Expected data/transaction volumes, critical performance points, batch/parallel handling, and tuning strategies.
9. Error, Exception & Message Handling
Error handling matrix, message class/numbering, and escalation/reprocessing procedures.
10. Logging & Audit Trail
Audit requirements, what/where is logged, retention, and traceability.
11. Testing Approach
Coverage for all scenarios, data requirements, regression/negative tests, and results tracking.
12. Transport & Deployment Details
Objects to transport, sequences, post-transport steps, and deployment checklist.
13. Impact Analysis
Impacted business processes/systems, risks, backward compatibility, downtime, and continuity planning.
14. Assumptions & Limitations
List of all business, system, and technical assumptions as well as open issues and known limitations.
15. Appendix & References
Glossary, SAP notes, supporting documentation, mockups, sample data, code fragments, versioning, and compliance references.
Action required:
Please expand each section with the necessary depth and documentation fidelity suitable for technical review, design authority sign-off,
